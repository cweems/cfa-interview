A few quick notes on my approach:

* I added a splash modal that takes the user directly to their city, so that they get the information the need faster.
* I thought through how to prioritize the information given and decided that current temperature and weather condition were the most important.
* I decided that wind chill and precipitation were probably as important for future days of the week as temperature and weather condition, so I omitted those to save space.
* Rather than have the information hidden in tabs, I opted for a scrolling approach, which I thought would be easier for mobile users.

Lots more I'd like to do, but this should be a good start!
